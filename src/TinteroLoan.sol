/// @title ERC721 Collateral Loan Interface
///
/// @notice Loan that uses an ERC721 token as collateral. The loan is funded with
/// an ERC20 token and structured in a series of payments and tranches they belong to.
///
/// This contract behaves as a state machine with the following states:
///
/// - CREATED: The loan has been initialized and payments or tranches are being added.
/// - CANCELED: The loan has been canceled and the collateral is being withdrawn.
/// - FUNDING: The loan is being funded by the liquidity provider.
/// - ONGOING: The loan has been funded and the payments are being repaid.
/// - DEFAULTED: The loan has defaulted and the collateral can be repossessed.
/// - REPOSSESSED: The collateral is being repossessed by the liquidity provider.
/// - PAID: The loan has been fully repaid.
///
/// == Concepts
///
/// - Payments: A payment is a structure that represents a payment to be made back to the loan.
///   Each payment has a principal amount and an interest rate that is accrued over time in a
///   linear fashion. A premium rate is added to the interest rate after the payment is due (at maturity).
/// - Tranches: A tranche is a collection of payments that have the same recipient. They are used
///   to sell parts of the loan to different investors.
/// - Collateral: The collateral is an ERC721 token that is used to back the payments. A payment's
///   collateral can be repossessed if the loan defaults after a default threshold.
///
/// NOTE: Users must approve this contract to transfer their ERC-721 tokens used as collateral.
/// This may allow a malicious actor to transfer request a loan and transferring their tokens
/// to this contract unexpectedly. For those cases, the original owner can retake their collateral
/// with the `withdrawPaymentCollateral` function.
